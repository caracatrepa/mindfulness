# Online MBSR (free)

Online Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR)

_This online MBSR training course is 100% free, created by a fully certified MBSR instructor, and is modeled on the program founded by Jon Kabat-Zinn at the [University of Massachusetts Medical School][1]. _

_I'm so glad you found this website! Here you will find a complete eight-week MBSR course, designed for people who are not able to take a live MBSR course for financial or logistical reasons. All of the materials used in the live course I teach, including guided meditations, articles, and videos are freely available here. - [Dave Potter][3]_

_Offering something for nothing does seem a little suspicious these days and I get many emails about this free online MBSR course, many of which ask one or more of the following questions:_

  
The short answer is "yes".&nbsp; There is no catch: no fees, no spam, you don't even need to identify yourself or give an email address. I receive no income personally from the site, not even indirectly. _Contributions make the course even more accessible to people around the world, but this is not expected nor required - see [About Contributions][4]. _

  
I am [fully certified as an MBSR instructor][5] by the University of Massachusetts Medical School and have been teaching live, in-person MBSR classes in my community for 12 years. I'm also a professional psychotherapist who has had a daily meditation practice for 25 years, and when I discovered MBSR, I wanted to offer it to my clients and my community. I started teaching my twice-yearly in-person classes in 2004 and, as a service to my students, began to put some parts of the class online. I soon realized that with a little work, the material could be useful to people who might not ever be able to attend a live MBSR class.

Creating and incrementally improving this resource has been a labor of love, and I'm happy to provide these materials without asking for a fee, something that is made possible given the economies of the internet, how the course is structured, and the generosity of other teachers. It pleases me to know that anyone with an internet connection, whether they live in Moscow, Idaho or Moscow, Russia, can find and use the rich set of materials here.

  
A live, in-person Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) class is still the best way to learn mindfulness, because it is more likely that you will complete the course, due to the live interaction and group support. _(NOTE: To find in-person MBSR offerings in your area, try a web search such as "MBSR Minneapolis" or "MBSR London".)_

But doing an in-person course is not always possible, for financial and logistical reasons. This online course uses precisely the same course curriculum and resources that are used in my local in-person course, and if you follow the suggestions and practices for each of the eight weeks of the course, the learning can be just as deep and profound. In fact, _**the end-of-course reports I've received from online graduates indicate that they benefit just as much as people who complete the in-person course. **_For some recent end-of-course reports, see [Testimonials / Gallery of Learning][6]. There are currently over 700 graduates of the Palouse Mindfulness course (see [Graduates' page][7] and [Graduate Map][8]).

That being said, it is a significant accomplishment to complete a course such as this on your own, and for that reason, I've done my best to make the experience interesting and varied, something made possible by the generosity of the world-renowned teachers***** whose videos and writings are posted on this site, including **_Jon Kabat-Zinn_** _(Wherever You Go, There You Are), **Pema Chodron** (When Things Fall Apart), **Tara Brach** (Radical Acceptance), **Sylvia Boorstein** (Don't Just Do Something, Sit There), **Sharon Salzberg** (A Heart As Wide as the World), **Robert Sapolsky** (Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers), **Marshall Rosenberg** (Non-Violent Communication), and **Jack Kornfield** (A Path with Heart).*_

  
This online course begins with an [Introduction][9] designed to give you a sense of mindfulness and an idea of how this course is structured. For each of the eight weeks, videos, readings and practices help you build a base of both knowledge and experience. [MBSR "At a Glance"][10] provides a brief outline of the MBSR course.

All of what you will need is accessible through this web site, and whether or not you actually take yourself through the course, the wealth of material here, including videos and writings by the teachers mentioned above and others_ _is freely available to you.

  
This course is completely self-guided (there is no registration and only you will be monitoring your progress, using the provided practice sheets). If you successfully complete the eight weeks of practice and study and send the materials indicated in [_Requesting a Certificate of Completion][11]_, I will send you a personal note of congratulations along with a certificate of completion. There is no cost for this. You simply submit the seven sets of practice sheets and a one page description of what you've learned and how you will be incorporating what you learned into your life.

_**If you are ready to begin, or if you'd just like to know more about mindfulness or this program, go to the** [Introduction][9]._

_ * **NOTE:** Much of the material in this course is drawn from the works of other teachers and writers in the spirit of making mindfulness more widely available. My thanks to them for helping to make this free Online MBSR course possible._
